# House-Price-Prediction
This project develops a predictive model to estimate house prices based on key features like area, number of rooms, number of bathroom etc. By analyzing historical data, the model will help buyers and sellers make informed decisions, minimizing the risk of overpricing or underpricing properties in the fluctuating real estate market.
